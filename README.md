- please report me all of your server crashes, bugs or suggestions.

### Bug fixes against BETA 2
#### Bug fixes:
- In readyup: when you spawn, red/green circle icon in scoreboard is bugged -> fixed
- Secondary weapon from round before overtime is saved to first round of overtime -> fixed
- Fixed menu for Russian weapons
- Fixed pb cvar range check for players with inverted mouse
- Custom colors of teams resets every round -> fixed
- Bomb timer is not visible when last player is killed -> fixed
- You cannot change nickname immediately in half ready-up -> fixed

#### New features:
- Shotgun rebalance was adjusted (see image on <a href="/images/shotgun.png">[3.3.9]</a> - last try before i decide to replace it with old shotgun)
- You can enable printing information about shotgun hits via /rcon set sg_debug 1
- Rebelanced shotgun can be turned off by command /rcon scr_shotgun_rebalance 0<br>
(these shotgun commands will be removed in final release)
- Toujane bug under A roof - fixed by new textures (see image on <a href="/images/toujane_underAroof_bug.jpg">[1.6]</a>)
- Toujane bucket model is now rendered from far distance (see image on <a href="/images/toujane_bucket_fixed.jpg">[1.7]</a>)
- Toujane B bomb tank model is rendered from far distance (see image on <a href="/images/toujane_B_bomb.jpg">[1.8]</a>)
- Added voting system for public mode (map voting at the end of the map)
- Russian side is enabled for PCW pam mode
- Deadchat is turned off for PCW pam mode
- Demo name for auto recording was shortened (5v5_toujane_team1_team2__id => tj_team1_team2__id)
(if you play in other number of players than 5, substring like 3v3 is added to demo name)
- Cvar cl_packetdup is forced from 1 to 3 now (testing)


<i>Note:<br>
While replaying demo recorded in new pam, you may see untextured horse model instead of shotgun.<br>
This is because of switchable shotguns. To fix this, you have run COD2 with command +set fs_game zpam310_beta3.<br>
To do that, create shorcut of CoD2MP_s.exe, open Properites and add that command after game path.</i>

- Download file <b><a href="/zpam310_beta3.zip">zpam310_beta3.zip</a></b> and extract folders with files into following locations:</b>

### 4. IDEAS
<sub>
[4.1] <del>player / server options (player settings, all rcon commands, new commands like set/reset score, move player to team, ...) </del><strong>(done as 3.3.13)</strong> <br>
[4.2] add more info in shoutcaster mode (weapon, grenades..., like in CS:GO) (+ keybindings for players, map overview)  <br>
[4.3] new binds for taking weapon class -&gt; like when the bind is pressed, player gets Thompson, MP44, or PPSh based on actual team&nbsp;<br>  
[4.4] increase sv_fps? <br>
[4.5] remove quickmessages (like "Follow me", "Move in!") in match pam mode  <br>
[4.6] remove "Explosives planted" voice sound for planter (just for planter, retain for rest of team) to avoid ninja defuse <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfRdlWHzUWQ"> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfRdlWHzUWQ </a>&nbsp; <br>
[4.7] suggestion to drop smoke instead of nade if sg gets killed before smoke was used  <br>
[4.8] get Russians back with modified ppsh <br>
[4.9] Spectator - keep following player from previsous round in new round (in current pam when new round started, spectator is moved to default position even if he was following some player...)<br>
</sub>


### 5. KNOWN BUGS
<sub>
[5.0] Diagonal bug<br>
    <a href="/images/diagonal.jpg"> <img src="/images/diagonal.jpg" alt="" height="721" /> </a> <br>
[5.1] Slide bug (when player hits the ground he can not stop moving. It looks like he is "sliding" on the ground) <br>
[5.2] Defusing with F12 (player can defuse outside plant area when screenshot bind and F is pressed at one time) <br>
[5.3] Smoke is not visible if player press F12 or game window is minimized <br>
[5.4] When some player plays with BAR weapon, all other players can hearing sounds of changing weapon on their side (happends when player with BAR is switching between BAR and pistol) <br>
[5.5] When player is defusing and he use binoculars - its seems like he is not defunsing and zooming with weapon (but weapon is not visible) <br>
[5.6] bind MOUSE1 "+attack;+smoke" -&gt; this bind silences gun<br>
[5.7] toujane bug - you get stuck in "link" if you crouch next to the wall  <br>
    <a href="/images/toujane_cigan.jpg"> <img src="/images/toujane_cigan.jpg" alt="" height="150" /> </a><br>
[5.8] Carentan MG house at doors. Prone push  <br>
    <a href="/images/carentan_mg_house_bug1.jpg"> <img src="/images/carentan_mg_house_bug1.jpg" alt="" height="150" /> </a> <br>
    <a href="/images/carentan_mg_house_bug2.jpg"> <img src="/images/carentan_mg_house_bug2.jpg" alt="" height="150" /> </a><br>
[5.9] Dawnville: Bug in last apartment <br>
    <a href="/images/dawnville_apartment_bug.jpg"> <img src="/images/dawnville_apartment_bug.jpg" alt="" height="150" /> </a><br>
[5.10] too hight mg sensitivity <br>
[5.11] switching from scope to other player while dead, you keep hearing the "scopeshot" <br>
[5.12] r_picmip can be abused, find a way to make sure picmip 3 cant be used <br>
[5.13] Carentan: make sure people cant jump on the B bombsite from sandbags with 333fps or from boxhouse.<br>
[5.14] Carentan: complaining about a bug behind the B bomb, the fences are bugged while scoping<br>
[5.15] MG clip bug - if you prone behind MG and press F to take it, enemy see you with a delay<br>
[5.16] You cannot hear sounds of players that are far away from you. In some spots you cannot hear sounds of players just around a corner. This is caused by map portals - every map is split up to portals. Only portals that you can see from your location are rendered by game engine. Unforcenetly players are also not rendered. Thats why you cannot hear your teammate shooting on A bombsite while you are on allies spawn for example.<br>
[5.17] Bash bug - you cannot bust while reload animation (untill weapon chamber is not fully refilled -> bash is blocked)<br>
[5.18] Burgundy low sky box - grenades are removed from game if you throw them above you with jump<br>

    <a href="/images/matmata_bug_2.jpg"><img src="/images/matmata_bug_2.jpg" alt="" height="150" /> </a><br>
[5.20] Tanks - some tanks dont have solid tank wheels - shots go throught them<br>
[5.21] <del>Toujane bug under A roof</del><br>
<b>Fixed, viz [1.6]</b><br>
    <a href="/images/toujane_bug.png"><img src="/images/toujane_bug.png" alt="" height="200" /> </a><br>
[5.22] Toujane bug in track on B bomb site - you can see enemy behind track boxes with jumping, but enemy cannot see you<br>
[5.23] Burgundy black tank - you can see enemy under tank wheels when you are far away from tank
