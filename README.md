# Introduction

Mod zPAM4.00 is a competitive mod for CoD2. <br>

The code from the previous version zPAM 2.07 was completely rewritten and ported to a new code base, which helped in the implementation of new features and bug fixes.

Work on this PAM was initiated by me in 2015 and was never fully finished. On corona days, I decided to finish it.

## Installation

- Download <b><a href="https://github.com/eyza-cod2/zpam3/releases/download/3.36/zpam336.zip">zPAM 3.36</a></b> and extract files into following locations:
	- ./Call of Duty 2/main/zpam336.iwd
	- ./Call of Duty 2/main/zpam_maps_v6.iwd <i>(*required only for 1.3 game version)</i>
	- ./Call of Duty 2/main/server.cfg


- Add ```+exec server.cfg``` into command line arguments

- Edit the ```server.cfg``` file to configure your server.

- Make sure the server is runned without a mod (```set fs_game ""```).
	- PAM uses default **main** folder because mods does not exec player's configs correctly and settings changed in game would not be persisted to next game session.


- For game version 1.3:
	- Mappack file <b>zpam_maps_v6.iwd</b> needs to be included in main folder. [What is zpam_maps_v6.iwd file?](#what-is-zpam_maps_v6iwd-file)
	- Fast download must be enabled via these settings (custom URL may be used):
		- <b>sv_wwwDownload 1</b>
		- <b>sv_wwwBaseURL "http://cod2x.me/zpam"</b>
	- This is to make sure that maps are downloaded in fast way for players

❗ Error <b>"PAM is not installed correctly"</b> may show. ❗<br>
To fix this error, follow instructions in [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section




If you are running server manually, this is example of command line parameters:<br>
```+set dedicated 2 +set sv_punkbuster 0 +pb_sv_disable +exec server.cfg```

### How does the "Hand hitbox fix" works / what is it
There are some weird situations when you shot player to the body, but the game process it as a hit only.
These types of bugs are probably caused by badly implemented hit boxes within the game engine.
In these situations the game process the hit location as hand / arm instead of body (when the arm is right behind the body)
Hand hitbox fix tries to address this issue by the following check:
<img src="images/hand_hitbox_fix.png"/>
 - if you fire from rifle or scope, and
 - distance between you and enemy is more than 200, and
 - hit location is inside a box created around head, and
 - head is visible to player (is not behind wall), and
 - damage is less then 100 (meaning it was hit only to hand)
 - 	In that case, damage is changed to 100 (meaning enemy will be killed)

The box is created in a way that its always aligned with your point of view and with deph wider towars you. The box is created in this way to cover hands of enemy inside the box when player is in ADS (zoomed). In that case, if you hit the hand from your point of view, it should be a kill, because body is behind the hand.

To apply this fix, the hit location must be inside the box. If the hitbox is outside the box, original damage values are applied.

You can debug hitbox fix in game via command **/rcon debug_handhitbox 1**<br>
**Hand hitbox fix is enabled by default**




<br>

### How does the "Torso hitbox fix" works / what is it
Hitbox area torso_lower is now slightly bigger to avoid weird hits to lower part of body.
This will take effect only for rifles, because other weapons have the same damage values for torso_lower and left/right_leg_upper.

<img src="images/hitbox_torso.png"/>

You can debug this in game via command **/rcon debug_torsohitbox 1**<br>
**Torso hitbox fix is enabled by default**

### Whats going on with shotgun
There were multiple versions of shotguns in a lifetime of new zPAM.
- Classic shotgun - original and zPAM2.07
- Rebalanced shotgun - zPAM3.22
- Consistent shotgun - zPAM3.30

The main goal of these shotgun versions is to avoid close range hits and long range kills.<br>
An improvement was made with rebalanced shotgun, but it still was not perfect. Consistent shotgun is the latest version.<br>
Shotgun problem analysis: https://youtu.be/7saFLaQoiwI
<br>
### How does the "Consistent shotgun" works / what is it
First of all, lets describe how the classic shotgun works:
- When you fire from shotgun, 8 pellets are fired.
- Spread of pellets is unpredictable and completly random.
- This ingame image demonstrates the ransomness of the pellets:
- <img src="images/shotgun_spread.png" height="60" />
- Damage of each individual pellet is based on distance between you and the pellet hit location.
- #### Shotguns chart
- <a href="images/shotgun.png"><img src="images/shotgun.png" /> </a>
- #### Original shotgun
	- Damage is splited into 2 range parts according to distance between you and hit location of enemy player: (this is how it is when the game was released in 2005)
	- Each one of 8 fired pellets follow this rules:
		- if **distance is 0 - 384**: constant **50hp damage** is applied for every pellet
		- if **distance is 384 - 800**: damage is linearly based on distance in range of **50hp - 5hp**
- #### Consistent shotgun
 - Consistent shotgun tries to address close range hits and long range kills.
   - Close range hits are caused by only 1 pellet hit the target, others goes off target
   - Long range kills are caused by pellets fired close together.
  - Random spread is responsible for these close range hits and long range kills
 - To make it better, consistent shotgun defines new damage values for close range and long range
 - Each one of 8 fired pellets follow these rules:
 	- Distance 0 - 250 (close range):
		- **100hp damage** is applied if you see head and body of enemy
		- **50 - 99hp damage** is linearly applied based on distance if head and body not visible
 	- Distance 250 - 384:
		- **50hp - 99hp** is linearly applied based on distance
 	- Distance 384 - 500:
		- **34hp - 49hp** is linearly applied based on distance
 	- Distance 500 - 800 (long range):
		- **0hp - 33hp** is applied; only 1 pellet is used, others are ignored
 - Examples:
	 - Example 1:
		 - You fire at close range (distance 150), **only 1 pellet** hits the target
			- original shotgun: **50hp damage**
			- rebalanced shotgun:
				- in case of hit to body: **kill**
				- in case of hit to hand: **~80hp damage**
			- consistent shotgun:
				- head and body visible: **kill**
				- head and body not visible: **~80hp damage**
	 - Example 2:
		 - You fire at close range (distance 150), **2 or more pellets** hits the target
			 - original shotgun: **kill**
			 - rebalanced shotgun: **kill**
			 - consistent shotgun: **kill**
	 - Example 3:
		- You fire at mid range (distance 280), **only 1 pellet** hits the target
			- original shotgun: **50hp damage**
			- rebalanced shotgun: **~63hp damage**
			- consistent shotgun: **~63hp damage**
	 - Example 4:
		- You fire at far range (distance 650), **5 pellets** hits the target
			- original shotgun: **~105hp damage** (~21hp damage per bullet)
			- rebalanced shotgun: **max 99hp damage** (total damage limited)
			- consistent shotgun: **~12hp damage**
 - You can debug consistent shotgun in game via command **/rcon debug_shotgun 1**

**Consistent shotgun is enabled by default**


 <br>

 ### How does the "Fast reload fix" works / what is it
 Fast reload is when you fire from KAR98 for example, press R to reload and then you scroll down 2x, you are able to shoot faster.
 PAM is blocking you from fast-switching weapon for short period of time after you fire from weapon.
 This take effect to following weapons: kar98k, kar98k_sniper, enfield, enfield_scope, mosin_nagant, mosin_nagant_sniper, springfield, shotgun.<br>
 You can debug fast-reload fix in game via command **/rcon debug_fastreload 1**.<br>
 **Fast reload fix is enabled by default.**




<br>

### How does the "Clip" and "Prone peek fix" works / what is it
Lets describe a "clip" and "prone-peek" a bit

- ### Clip
	- In zPAM2.07, when you go from prone position to crouch position, a "standing-up" animation was played on player's character
	- If you go immediately back to prone position, the animation makes you invisible to enemy, because before your body and head gets to higher position, you are back in prone position
	- This animation is well described on this image:
	- <img src="images/clip.gif" height="100"/>
	- This animation bug is fixed in zPAM3, but there is still one problem described below
- ### Prone-peek
	- Prone peek is when you go from prone position to crouch position and then immediately back to prone position.
	- If you also lean left/right while standing-up, your head is moving too fast from side to center position.
	- For enemy its difficult to shoot, because character animation is moving too fast and it seems like bugged character animation
	- The prone-peek fix just make sure you stay in crouch position 400ms longer.
	- This delay is applied only if:
	  - pronepeek-able wall / cover is detected (cover that block your view in prone position, but not in crouch position)
	  - you are in ads (zoomed in)
	- You can debug prone-peek fix in game via command **/rcon debug_pronepeek 1**
- **Prone-peek fix is enabled by default**



<br>

### How does the "MG clip" fix works / what is it
Clipping a MG is situation, when you grab a MG while you are behind cover and you immidietely drop it. This makes you almost impossible to kill you, while you can easily get opponent's positions.
MG clip fix make sure you are spawned right behind the MG every time you drop the MG.<br>
Note: your teammates that are spectating you may see you "lagging". Thats normal and is caused by the way I used to fix this bug.<br>
**MG clip fix is enabled by default**



<br>

### How does the "Enemy list" works
Enemy list is feature that show names of alive player from opponent team. This feature can be enabled / disabled via menu.
You can change color of opponent team via scoreboard menu. Button "Set" will toggle between red, blue and white color.<br>
<img src="images/enemylist_setcolor.png" /><br>
If you change a color, its applied to team, so your teammates can also see the colors.



<br>

### How does the "Round report" works
At the end of the round, report of hits and kills is printed. It include damage value, hit location and first hit location. For shotgun it prints number of pellets that hit the target and range. Read star indicates that "Hand hitbox fix" or "Torso hitbox fix" was applied.<br>
<img src="images/round_report.png" />



<br>

### How does the "Double kill" works
- Lets describe a situation when you fire a bullet to players that are lined right behind each other. When you fire, a "bullet-trace" is computed - it will find a first player in front of you, and this trace continue until it encounter an obstacle (wall, dead body, etc..)

- #### Old pam:
	- "bullet-trace" will find first player, witch receive damage, that is processed into kill and player dead body is spawned; bullet trace now continues from position of this player, but because there is a dead body spawned, the bullet-trace stops here (because dead-body is an obstacle) and the second player did not receive damage at all; there was situation where dead-body were spawned at slightly different position/angle then player body (on rough terrain for example) and then the bullet trace was able to continue. That's why the double kills were very rare on old pam

- #### New pam
	- in new pam, the dead-body is spawned after the bullet-trace is completely processed - that means the bullet is never stopped by spawned dead-bodies of players killed by this bullet and you can get double kills more easily



<br>

### What is "Diagonal" bug
Diagonal bug is when you walk forward + left/right + lean left/right + in ads. Doing this to the left side (walk forward + left + lean left + ads) makes our head and body rotated more to the right + down. This make you in an advantage position, because you can see enemy sooner then enemy sees you.
Option witch disabled leaning left/right when walking forward + left/right, preventing you from doing diagonal was removed from PAM, since it was affecting the player movement quite much.
So diagonal is not affected by PAM.



<br>

### How does the "Sniper shotgun info" works / what is it
At the start of the round and at the end of the round, info about weapons of players with sniper and shotgun is showed next to compass. If player does not have a secondary weapon, text is gray. If player does have a secondary weapon, text is green.

<img src="images/sniper_shotgun_info.png"/>



 <br>
 <br>

 ### How does the "Climbing fix" works / what is it

If you climb ladder or wall, the "weapon switch" sound was made only for 1st person player, it was silent for other players. The sound is now removed completly - meaning if you climb ladder or wall, "weapon switch" sound is not played at all - same for everybody

###### Original:

| Player	| Climb ladder	| Climb wall 	|
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| You		| sound		| sound		|
| Others	| -		| -		|


###### since zPAM3.32:

| Player	| Climb ladder	| Climb wall 	|
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| You		| -		| -		|
| Others	| -		| -		|

This sound is played only if you regularly and intentionally switch the weapon


<br>


### Scoreboard menu
<img src="images/scoreboard_columns.png" />
<br><br>

Features:
- shows statistics of players - Score, Kills, Deaths, Assists, Hits, Grenade kills, Plants and Defuses
- It will always show disconnected players (with [-] prefix) for 5 mins (so you see stats for all players in final scorebard)
- Only Kills and Deaths will are showed for enemy team (to avoid recognize enemy position by watching the scoreboard)

##### How the Score, Kills, Deaths, Assists, Hits, Plant and Defuses are counted

### How damage debug cvar works
At the end of each round, debug info about hits is saved into cvar **pam_damage_debug**.<br>

Format:<br>
{time}|{miliseconds}|dmg:{damage}|health:{enemy_health}|xyz_my:{my_origin}|xyz_enemy:{enemy_origin}|{weapon}|{hitLocation}|xyz_hit:{hit_origin}|head:{head_origin}|pelvis:{pelvis_origin}

Example:<br>

These cvars can be read from demo.





<br>

### How does the zPAM settings works
zPAM uses cvar /server16 to save custom settings. This cvar is used because value of this cvar is saved into config when game is closed.<br>
Format: "item_value|item2_value2|...". <br>
Example: "autorecording_1|matchinfo_1|score_0|playersleft_1"


<br>

### How does the "Aim-Trainer" feature works / what is it
- <img src="images/aim_trainer.png" /><br><br>
- In Ready-Up period, it is possible to spawn targets and practice your aim.
- These targets are supported only on FIX versions of maps or maps that directly supports it.
- Hold Shift to toggle between different modes of aim trainer:
	- Mode 1: Static mode - targets are not moving and you have to shot the target within 500ms
	- Mode 2: Moving targets - targets are moving
	- Mode 3: Fast moving targets - targets are moving faster
	- Mode 4: Reaction time - targets spawn with random delay and your reaction time is measured
- Double press Shift to turn off aim trainer.


<br>

### How does the "LOD fix" feature works / what is it
- Every model has multiple versions of itself with varying detail depending on distance between player and model.
- PAM forces tanks, cars, trucks, and artillery flak to be always rendered at high detail
- This fixes holes in low detailed models at long distances
- It may slightly increase the load and therefore decrease the FPS

		- Score progress
		- Player xvx progress
		- Hit info
		- Planter / defuser info
	- Auto-spectator

#### HUD overlay
- <img src="images/streamer_menu.png" /><br><br>
- When you join a streamer team, a new **streamer menu** overlay will open
- Streamer menu is needed to detect mouse and keys detection
- Binds are not working while this menu is open
- To use the binds (eg. for chat), you have to close this menu first with Esc key
- When the streamer menu is joined for the first time, you have to confirm this via Space key.
- Once confirmed, you will automatically join streamer menu again when the map changes
- You are automatically set as ready in Ready-up period.
- Players are automatically renamed if their nickname contains double-colors (^^xx) when there is a streamer. (reason: avoid confusing team colors for viewers of stream)

##### Match info
- <img src="images/streamer_menu_teams.png" /><br>
- Teams are always on the same side
- Only the color of team is changing according to side of the team (allies: blue, axis: red)

##### Followed player info
- Under the "following" text, there is a status of player switching
- <img src="images/streamer_following_status.png" /><br>
- It tells the reason why the followed player was changed
- Greenish background color means that spectated player can be changed by auto-spectator at any time
- Grayish background color means that this player is locked for some time
- No background color means auto-spectator is turned off and switching is controlled manually

##### Players bars

	- Health - indicated by the changed width of colored bar
	- Weapons (pistols are not showed)
	- Number of greandes / smokes
	- Kills and deaths
	- Number of kills in this round (indicated with green color next to kills and deaths)
- When the player is dead, bar is more transparent and dead icon is showed
- Currently followed player is indicated with white rectangle with an arrow next to it
- Players are sorted by their ID and not via score<br><br>
- <img src="images/streamer_player_bars.png" /><br>
- You can use keys [1,2,3,4,5] to switch to player from team 1 and keys [6,7,8,9,0] from team 2

##### Planter / defuser info
- <img src="images/streamer_plant_defuse.png" /><br>
- When some player is planting or defusing a bomb, its indicated on the screen

<br><br>

#### Auto-spectator
- Auto-spectator is the name for following functions:
- It automatically switch between players according to game situation
- The following situations are taken into account:
	- Player has an enemy's head in sight
	- Player will have an enemy's head in sight (predicted player movement)
	- Player just planted the bomb
	- Players are close to each other
	- You are last player in team
	- Its 1v1 and you are in the losing team<br><br>
- At round start, automatically followed player is selected by these steps:
  - Round 1: Sniper of team allies
  - Round 2: Sniper of team axis
  - Round 3: Sniper of team allies
  - Round 4: Sniper of team axis
  - Round 5: Shotgunner of team allies
  - Round 6: Shotgunner of team axis
  - Next rounds follow this pattern:
	  - Round 7: Best player of team allies
	  - Round 8: Best player of team axis
	  - Round 9: sniper of team allies
	  - Round 10: sniper of team axis
	  - ...

- You can replay an action via opening replay menu via R key and choosing the action via [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] keys
- Actions are automatically replayed at the end of the round (if there are any)
- Only 40 seconds of history can be saved - it means actions cannot be played after 40 seconds they happend (game limitation)
- If some of the interesting actions happens (bash, nozoom or 2 and more kills) and there is no reason to switch the followed player via auto-spectator, a replay proposal is showed:
- <img src="images/streamer_killcam_proposal.png" /><br>
- You have a few seconds to press a F key to replay the action

<br>

## Known bugs
 - You cannot take screenshot of new scoreboard via F12 (in menu binds are not working)
 - When you spawn a bot in strat, this bot will occupy player slot on server even if the bot is kicked; server restart is needed then

<br>
<br>

## Troubleshooting
### Error "zPAM is not installed correctly"
#### Cvar /fs_game is not empty!
Make sure cvar /fs_game is empty (+set fs_game "") and iwd files are placed in main folder.

#### Iwd file zpam334.iwd must be installed in main folder.
 - Since version 3.20, all iwd files have to be installed in main folder.
This is because of bug that player's settings changed in game are not saved into the config when running a game with fs_game set.

#### Iwd file zpam_maps_v6.iwd does not exists in main folder
- Since version 3.20, fixed versions of some maps are available. PAM is forcing to include these files to make sure maps are available on every server.

#### Error while getting loaded iwd files. Make sure iwd files does not contains spaces.
- PAM was not able to parse loaded iwd files. Some of the iwd files have probably name with spaces.

####  WWW downloading must be enabled. Set sv_wwwDownload and sv_wwwBaseURL
- You have to enable www downloading via cvar /sv_wwwDownload 1 and specify a download url via cvar /sv_wwwBaseURL "url".
- If you dont have any url, you can use /sv_wwwBaseURL "http://cod2x.me/zpam"
- This is to make sure fixed maps are downloaded in fast way for players

####  Old zPAM or maps detected in main folder. Delete iwd file you see above.
- Your main folder contains also a other versions of pam or maps. Delete all .iwd files that the game prints on screen.



### Error "recursive error after: Can´t create Dvar 'xxx': 1280 dvars already exist"
This error happens when you have defined more than 1280 cvars in game.
You have to clean your config from useless cvars. If you dont know that cvars to delete, create a new profile and compare these 2 configs. Normal config should have ~400 lines.
This PAM defines ~200 new cvars for all of the features, so if your config contains a lot of mess, it may be the trigger for this error.


### Error "Info string length exceeded"
This error happens when you have too many .iwd files in main folder or name of all .iwd files exceed some limit.<br>
How the error may looks like:<br>
**Info string length exceeded<br>
key: 'sv_referencedIwds'<br>
value : '...'<br>
Info string:<br>
\bg_fallDamageMaxHeight\480 ...**<br>
This is game bug - to workaround this error, remove unused iwd files / shorten the name of iwd files / pack multiple iwd files together.



### Error "Impure client detected. Invalid .IWD files referenced!"
- This error means that .iwd files loaded from your local folders (main) are in conflict with .iwd files located at server - some files are not equal. This is protection agains your modified files that may be used for cheating.
- There is a problem with zpam_maps_v1.iwd file - when you have this file downloaded in main folder and you try to connect older 3.22 server, error "Impure client detected" shows. (Toujane FIX and Brungundy FIX sun file problem) Please remove this file from main folder.
- <img src="images/error_impure_client_detected.png"/>

This should avoid these situations: you are proned, leaned left/right and you peek behind the wall by going to crouch and back to prone as fast as possible.

[3.3.46] <del>Hand hit box fix - if hands are in front of body and game somehow badly interprets it as hit to the hand, PAM change it to hit to the body; its an extension to already existing fix in 3.22 for left hand - now its applies also for right hand</del> <strong>replaced with [3.3.71]</strong><br>
[3.3.47] Torso hitbox fix; lower torso hitbox (pelvis area) is slightly enlarged as workaround for bad hitbox registration between torso_lower and right/left_leg_upper; this change effectively applies only for rifles, because other weapons has the same damage for torso_lower and right/left_leg_upper<br>

[4.2] <del>add more info in shoutcaster mode (weapon, grenades..., like in CS:GO) (+ keybindings for players, map overview)  </del> <strong>implemented in [3.3.30]</strong><br>
[4.3] new binds for taking weapon class -&gt; like when the bind is pressed, player gets Thompson, MP44, or PPSh based on actual team&nbsp;<br>  
[4.4] increase sv_fps? <br>
[4.5] remove quickmessages (like "Follow me", "Move in!") in match pam mode  <br>
[4.6] remove "Explosives planted" voice sound for planter (just for planter, retain for rest of team) to avoid ninja defuse <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfRdlWHzUWQ"> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfRdlWHzUWQ </a>&nbsp; <br>
[4.7] suggestion to drop smoke instead of nade if sg gets killed before smoke was used  <br>
[4.8] get Russians back with modified ppsh <br>
[4.9] <del>Spectator - keep following player from previsous round in new round (in current pam when new round started, spectator is moved to default position even if he was following some player...)</del> <strong>implemented in [3.3.30]</strong><br>
</sub>


### 5. KNOWN BUGS

[5.3] Smoke is not visible if player press F12 or game window is minimized <br>
[5.4] <del>When some player plays with BAR weapon, all other players can hearing sounds of changing weapon on their side (happends when player with BAR is switching between BAR and pistol)</del> <strong>fixed, check [1.13]</strong> <br>
[5.5] When player is defusing and he use binoculars - its seems like he is not defunsing and zooming with weapon (but weapon is not visible) <br>
[5.6] bind MOUSE1 "+attack;+smoke" -&gt; this bind silences gun<br>
[5.7] <del>toujane bug - you get stuck in "link" if you crouch next to the wall</del> <strong>fixed in mp_toujane_fix</strong> <br>
