First we need to determine wich team will be first
 - do this by saving information who connect to this server first - his team will be first
 - we will save time when player connect to the server

Procces is splited to 2 parts
 - 1. Readyup - in this period team names are not fixed and info may be refrshed according to connecting players
 - 2. Match start - in this part team names will be saved and will not refresh

Player names cannot be changed too much during match, othervise match info will reset
